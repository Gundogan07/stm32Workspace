# STM32 DHT11 - UART Example

In this example, I used a DHT11 sensor to measure humidity and temperature without any library except HAL libraries. 

Configuration made in STM32CubeMx. Used following peripherals in this project

* 3 - GPIO (2 Led, 1 DHT)
* 1 Timer (To measure uS delay)
* 1 Uart (to send measured values to PC)
